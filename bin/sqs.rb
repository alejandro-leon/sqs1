# This code is written in the Ruby programming language.  
# User Case story for this program:
# The resulting program is a prototype for the "Sales quoting system" and the target
# user is the salesperson.
# When run, the program first reads an external file which contains data about products
# (the products are the different service contracts to safeguard a customer's device).
# Each line read in the file is a product captured in the following format:"Option,
# Service Product, SLA, Weight, Price" (note: the weight is not the actual weight of the 
# product, but a number used to calculate possible discounts).  The file can be edited 
# by the user to change or add more items if needed before it is loaded into the system.
# At the command prompt, the user is asked to authenticate.  After successfully being
# identified by the system, the user is required to input the user's and the customer's 
# information first.  Then the system requests the user to input the customer's device's
# name  and the number of devices that fit this same description that the customer wishes
# to cover with the service product to be selected.  Immediately afterwards, a menu 
# with the various service products is displayed and the user has to select one of them
# for the described device(s).
# After all this input, the user is asked if she/he wants to add another device to the
# list.  If yes, the steps to add a device and its repective service product are
# repeated for the new one.  If not, the final report with all the information entered
# is displayed along with the total price (with discounts if applicable) of the
# selected products with their repective quantities.

# Here, the program loads the class "Control" which is a library containing the methods
# to produce different actions and display various forms.
load "./products.rb"
# A new object is created called "fromProducts" from the Product class
fromProducts = Product.new
# The object calls the load_product_list method to read product data from external file
fromProducts.load_product_list
# The file with the "User" class is loaded here, which contains user related methods.
load "./users.rb"
# Another object is created here to manage users, this one is from the User class.
fromUsers = User.new
# The object calls the load_user_list method to read user data from external file

# The file with the "Quote" class is loaded here, which contains quoting helper methods.
load "./quotes.rb"
# Another object is created here to manage quotes, this one is from the Quotes class.
